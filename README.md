# Gauss-Jordan-Solver 
Solves n x (n+1) matrix by performing Gauss Jordan Elimination method.

## Input
The code takes input from Data.txt file.
```
n
n x (n+1)
```
Enter *n* in the first line.
Enter the *n x (n+1)* matrix row by row starting from the second line.

## Output
There are three possible solution cases.
- Unique Solution
- Infinitely Many Solutions : Finds an arbitrary solution by giving non-basic variables *zero*.
- No Solution

The code prints the corresponding solution case.
